          <p>I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users. I’m designing for and their needs. A primary user group identified through research was working adults who don’t have time to go to café to stand in cue for ordering. This user group confirmed initial assumptions about JavaJunction customers, but research also revealed that time was one of the main factor which was limiting users from having coffee. Other user problems included interests in coffee or tea, or it becomes cool on the way to their office and challenge for them to ask money from there colleagues or friends with whom they have ordered.</p>
